First usage
~~~~~~~~~~~

When you invoke this program for the first time, it will look for the file __~/.autocomment/constants__

If the program does not find the file, it will prompt you to enter your name, section, and email.

As long as the file remains, the program will use the information in that file to populate the header.

If the file is deleted, it will prompt the user to input the required information again.


Entering Descriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each file in the supplied directory, the program will prompt the user to enter a description for the file.

An empty line signals the end of description input. The program then prompts for the next file until all files have a description.
