# autocomment++

The sequel to the critically acclaimed (hey, if I'm my worst critic that still means I'm a critic, right?) autocomment toolchain.

autocomment++ comments C++ files which also works for basically any language that is not python

with some bash aliases this makes adding header comments very quick
